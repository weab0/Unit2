 <h1> Education required to become an animator
   <h2>You dont need one!</h2>
<p>In order to become an animator, all you really need is a drawing tablet, a computer, and art skills.
  But a degree does help when apply for animation jobs. A college degree will help teach you tips and tricks of animation and
  will overall help your animation become more prefesional. But in order to get an animation job, a degree isnt required.</p>
